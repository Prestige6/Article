            <h4>Ascending Biomes is a "obby" game based or inspired by the infamous "Tower Of Hell" Ascending Biome has
                a broad Target audience of Casual players who are just there to play for a couple of minutes to Hardcore
                games who are able to spent days upon the game, Ascending biome has a playstyle similar to "Tower Of
                Hell" where
                you have to climb a tower within the given amount of time, you ahve to overcome obstacles and look out
                for the mutators which can be bough by the players for in-game cash in the shop, and you can spend
                in-game cash in the shop to buy various accesories such as halos, trails, effects, mutators</h4>

        <h1>Key Featues</h1>
        <h4>one of the main and unique features of Ascending Biomes are the <span>Races, Crates, Achievements, Fast
                Paces Gameplay, Competetitive Aspects</span> all of these features makes Ascending Biome stand out more
            then the rest of the copy paste Towers and dominances the Algorithim of Roblox, all of these features also
            increases time spent playing for a majority of the playerbase as any competitive games are known for
            bringing long-term gamers</h4>
        <h4>although Ascending Biomes dose indeed has a bunch of neat features there are still somethings missing and
            could be improved on, one of them being the User Interface, it necessarily isn't a beauty its super buggy
            and the achievments feel unresponsive and all of them look a bit plain, I suggest for the game designers of
            that game to take a bunch of inspiration from tower of hell as it has a neat and modern-ish design which can
            be a good style for the game as it matches with its gameplay</h4>

        <h1>Suggestions</h1>
        <h4>Although the game is still in beta there are still a bunch of edits that could be made to make the game have
            a much better User Experience and overall increase the games potential, I believe the first thing would be
            to make a trailer! although most developers overlook this but it can make the difference from 10k visits to
            100k visits especiall for games that have a <span>Pay to Access</span>, I belive that the map could use some
            work as it is a not big enough which can cause wierd camera angle and the map is too noisy as there are way
            to many details and some levels even has transparent wall which causes more confusion and makes it harder
            for the user to focus on the obby and having detials outside of the map dosn't help either, and the stages
            are a bit too unconsistent as some have a bunch of detials and some can be plain and un-decored</h4>
